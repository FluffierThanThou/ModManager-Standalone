                <p>At the moment, it's just me.</p>

                <p>I decided to make a stand-alone mod manager in addition to my in-game mod manager. Why? Because I could. 
                I'm always trying to learn new tech, and I though it was about time I did a desktop app. I chose to work with Electron because it allowed me to use a web development stack. That makes for a prettier app, and a less intimidating UI toolkit.</p>

                <p>That choice also means that anyone with some web dev skill can help. Anyone with some web dev skills is more than welcome to join the team!</p>
